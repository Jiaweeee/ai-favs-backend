       <h3>Certificate vs. certification: what's the difference?</h3> 
       <p>The terms certificate and certification are often used interchangeably. However, they can differ in content, structure, and meaning depending on the offering organization. <i>Certificates</i> typically emphasize training and academic accomplishment whereas <i>certifications</i> indicate professional experience or that you've passed a certification exam that requires specialized skills.&nbsp;</p>

     <h2>How to choose a machine learning program that's right for you</h2> 
     <p>To identify which learning path is best for your career goals, consider these factors:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><p><b>Course content. </b>Identifying focus areas for your professional development can help you narrow your choices. Note specific skills you want to gain such as feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, or model evaluation and match them to program descriptions.&nbsp;</p></li> 
     </ul> 
     <ul> 
      <li><p><b>Duration. </b>Juggling professional development while working full-time, going to school, or caring for other obligations can be challenging. Make sure the workload and deadlines associated with your chosen learning path feel manageable.&nbsp;</p></li> 
     </ul> 
     <ul> 
      <li><p><b>Outcome. </b>Consider why you want to earn a certificate or certification. If you're looking for a new role, browse job postings for positions you're interested in and make a note of requested skills and credentials. Some employers request certifications by name. If many of the qualifications are skill-based or you want to study prior to taking an exam, you may benefit from a certificate program.&nbsp;</p></li> 
     </ul> 
     <ul> 
      <li><p><b>Cost. </b>Although it depends on the offering organization, certification prices sometimes include only the exam price. Prior training or study materials may be available at a separate cost. Research what the price of your chosen certificate includes before enrolling and consider whether or not you'll also need instruction.&nbsp;</p></li> 
     </ul> 
     <ul> 
      <li><p><b>Prerequisites. </b>If you're looking for an introduction to machine learning, consider selecting a certification program at the beginner level. Beginner-level certificate programs are designed to cover essential concepts to build foundational expertise. Those with background knowledge in the machine learning field may benefit more from intermediate-level or advanced programs that focus on machine learning techniques and technical skills.&nbsp;</p></li> 
     </ul>
