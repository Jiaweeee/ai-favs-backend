    We removed all NSFW queries from this list. What you see above are the top 100 “clean” search queries. You can see the full list with NSFW keywords in Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer.&nbsp; 
    Before we move on to the next list of trending keywords, it’s important to understand what search volume is and how it&nbsp;works. 
    Search volume 
    Search volume shows how many times a given keyword gets searched for in Google per month. And because the search demand for many keywords tends to fluctuate from month to month, the number that we give you is an annual average.

     Top 100+ Google searches in 200+ countries 
      
     
    Looking to see more than the top 100 Google searches? 
    Go to Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer, choose Google as the search engine, leave the search field blank, then hit search. You’ll see every keyword in our database for your chosen country sorted by monthly search volume in descending order. 
     
      
     
    Need to see the most searched keywords in another country? 
    Hit the dropdown and choose one of the 200+ countries in our database. 
     
      
     
    We also show SEO metrics like Traffic Potential (TP), Keyword Difficulty (KD), clicks, CPC, and Parent Topic for each keyword. 
    To see the current top-ranking pages for any query, hit the SERP button. 
     
      
     
     
      
     Top 100+ Google searches in your&nbsp;niche 
      
     
    Did you know that you can use the keyword ideas reports in Keywords Explorer to find the most popular searches on any&nbsp;topic? 
    For example, if you search for “netflix” and go to the Matching terms report, there are over 2.9 million keyword ideas sorted by monthly search volume. 
     
      
     
    How is this useful? 
    Imagine that you run a website about movie reviews. You can filter this report for queries containing the word “review” to find the most popular Netflix shows people want reviews for. 
     
      
     
    If you then add a KD filter into the mix, you can narrow down the report to find the easiest topics to rank&nbsp;for.
